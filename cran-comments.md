## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Reworded the package 'description' field in DESCRIPTION and added the authors' 
  abbreviated first names (letters) to hopefully clarify words that were 
  identified as *possibly misspelled*.

* Removed invalid fields 'Created' and 'Email' in DESCRIPTION.

* Replaced `\url{}` with `\doi{}` and fixed nested `\emph{}` in 
  'tsbalancing.Rd'.

* Wrapped lengthy examples in `\donttest{}`.


## R CMD check results

* This is a new release.
