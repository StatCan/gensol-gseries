## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated field 'title' in DESCRIPTION.

* Added a return value to function aliases (Rd-tag `\value` in 'aliases.Rd').

* Replaced operator `<<-` with environment specific assignments (for more predictive behaviour).


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
